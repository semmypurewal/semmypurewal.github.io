<p>I had a problem installing hashlib on a joyent smartmachine via npm.  This may be related to <a href="https://github.com/brainfucker/hashlib/issues/17">the patch</a> Ryan Dahl submitted last month.  So perhaps the npm installation will work soon.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I managed to get hashlib working by creating an empty hashlib directory in the root directory of my repository and pushing my repo.  Next I ssh&#8217;d into my smartmachine, cloned the hashlib <a href="https://github.com/brainfucker/hashlib">git repository</a> into the home directory of my smartmachine, entered the hashlib directory and did something like</p>

<div class="code">node-waf configure build
cp ~/hashlib/build/default/hashlib.node ~/node-service/current/hashlib/hashlib.node
node-service-restart</div>

<p>It seems to work, but if you&#8217;re following along at home make sure that when requiring the module in server.js (or whatever) you specify the path full path to the file:</p>
<div class="code">var hashlib = require(&#8216;./hashlib/hashlib.node&#8217;);</div>

<p>Happy hashing!</p>
