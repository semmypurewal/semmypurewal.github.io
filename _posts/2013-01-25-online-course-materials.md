Last year I started using this blog to post content for students taking my classes in the Computer Science department at UNC Asheville. It   s clear to me now that some of the content has become very useful to others; Google analytics tells me that I get between 30 and 50 hits a day, particularly on my material relating to Node.js.

These statistics both excite and frighten me     I   m doing my best to make sure the information is current and helpful, but I can   t always guarantee that will be the case.

On the other hand, based on the response that I   ve received, I   ve decided to start putting as much of my course material online as possible. Obviously that   s not something that I can do overnight, but my goal is to take tiny steps towards creating meaningful, helpful online material for those interested in learning more about computing and technology.

To that end, I   ve created a YouTube channel and uploaded 6 initial videos for two of my courses: Web Programming and Creative Computing. Please note that the YouTube videos don   t include all of my course content, but they do includes some of the content that I felt that I could meaningfully share in the form of videos. I   m working on finding ways of sharing the other material as well.

I   m always happy to get feedback or suggestions on the content and quality of the videos (or anything else). So feel free to leave comments on YouTube, or to tweet at me on Twitter. I   ll post more details about both of the courses in blog posts over the coming days.
