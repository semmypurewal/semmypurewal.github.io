Saw Bit Brigade, The Bronzed Chorus and Eszett at Caledonia on July 23.


Eszett is from Greensboro, NC and sounds a lot like Pelican with HUM thrown in for good measure.  I   m a huge fan of both of those bands, so I was pretty impressed.

The Bronzed Chorus is a two-piece, instrumental band.  They sounded a bit like Maserati (which I think is a positive thing) with some added atmospheric electronics.  Here   s a picture of them along with some dude   s head.

Bit Brigade impressed as always.  They played the soundtrack to Ninja Gaiden while a very talented gamer beat the game without dying (or even suffering any considerable damage).
