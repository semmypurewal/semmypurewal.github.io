# processingjs_ide

This is a rewrite of the sketch.processing.org ide using ajax.org's Ace editor instead of the now defunct Bespin editor.

It also uses Jermaine ( https://github.com/semmypurewal/jermaine ) as a data modeling library.

This repo contains Jermaine as a submodule. So to clone, do the following:

     git clone https://github.com/semmypurewal/processing.js-ide.git ide
     cd ide
     git submodule update --init

It's MIT Licensed, so feel free to use it for whatever.
